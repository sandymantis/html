1. **Strong Full Stack Engineering Background**: A Technical Architect typically has an extensive full stack engineering background, often encompassing 8-10 years of experience. This experience is broad, covering multiple programming paradigms, including expertise in various front-end and back-end technologies. They are proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks like React or Angular. On the back-end, they are skilled in languages such as Python, Java, or Node.js, and familiar with server, network, and hosting environments. Additionally, they possess robust database management skills with both SQL and NoSQL databases. A deep understanding of DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines is also crucial, enabling them to streamline and automate the software development processes.

2. **Full Spectrum Architecture Experience**: Beyond their full stack capabilities, a Technical Architect demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of multiple areas of architecture:
    - **Object-Oriented Principles and Design Patterns**: They have a firm grasp of object-oriented programming concepts and can effectively implement various design patterns.
    - **Application Security and Cryptography**: Their knowledge extends to securing applications, employing cryptography where necessary to protect data.
    - **Networking Fundamentals**: They understand networking concepts, which are crucial for designing scalable and efficient systems.
    - **Performance Engineering and Capacity Planning**: Skills in optimizing system performance and planning for future capacity needs are essential.
    - **Advanced Database Knowledge**: Their database expertise includes not just traditional SQL but also NoSQL and distributed graph databases.
    - **Cloud Architecture**: Proficiency in architecting solutions on public cloud platforms like AWS or Azure is a key aspect.
    - **Machine Learning and Deep Learning Fundamentals**: They possess a foundational understanding of ML and AI technologies.
    - **UI/UX Design Awareness**: Knowledge of user experience and interface design is important for overseeing the development of user-centric applications.
    - **Virtualization Technologies**: Familiarity with virtual machines and containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes is vital.

3. **Expertise in Healthcare Data and Technology**: In a healthcare organization like UGH, to be successful, a Technical Architect must have an in-depth understanding of healthcare data, including various data domains, datasets, and systems of record. They should also be aware of the technological landscape, platform ecosystems, and the strategic priorities of the enterprise. This specialized knowledge enables them to align technical solutions with healthcare-specific requirements and regulations.

4. **Leadership, Influence, and Ethics**: A pivotal aspect of their role involves partnering with senior technology and business leaders. The ability to influence and inspire is crucial, requiring excellent communication and interpersonal skills. High ethical and moral standards are non-negotiable, as they build trust and establish credibility in their leadership role.

5. **Industry Perspective and Innovation**: Having an industry perspective is critical. This allows them to not only address current business challenges but also to foresee and create new opportunities using technology. Their broad and deep understanding of tech trends enables them to innovate and guide the organization towards future growth and success.

Big Picture Orientation and Attention to Detail: Technical Architects have the unique ability to work on the 'big picture', conceptualizing and strategizing at a high level, while also being incredibly detail-oriented. They can dive into the minutiae of technical issues, ensuring that every aspect of the system is meticulously crafted and aligns perfectly with the overall strategy. This dual focus is critical in effectively managing complex technology projects and ensuring that every component of the IT architecture not only functions optimally on its own but also fits seamlessly into the larger system.

In summary, a Technical Architect is a multifaceted professional whose breadth and depth of skills span from hands-on technical expertise to strategic leadership. They play a critical role in shaping technology strategy, driving innovation, and ensuring that technology solutions are aligned with business goals and industry standards. Their ability to influence and lead, combined with a strong ethical foundation, makes them instrumental in guiding organizations through the complex and ever-evolving landscape of technology.
